# ESP32 Web-Based PWM LED Controller with Real-Time Graphs

This project implements a self-contained web server on the ESP32 module, enabling real-time control and visualization of an LED's brightness using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). It runs in **Wi-Fi Access Point mode**, so no external Wi-Fi is needed.
